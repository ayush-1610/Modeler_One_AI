# Changelog

Every notable change to Modeler One, newest first. **Any commit that changes behaviour adds an entry here in the
same commit** — see `CLAUDE.md`. Each entry says what changed, why, and the commit, so the history survives a change
of person, session or AI model.

Status words: **Added** new capability · **Changed** behaviour altered · **Fixed** a defect, with its impact ·
**Known gap** a limitation we know about and have not yet fixed · **Docs** / **Infra** as named.

Where things stand right now, stage by stage, is in `docs/CONTINUATION_PACKAGE.md` §4 (pipeline coverage).

## [Unreleased] — make the pipeline do real PBPK, S0 → S7
Plan: `docs/plans/2026-09-24-s0-s7-real-pbpk.md`. Scope agreed 2026-09-24: complete every MS-01 stage, prove it on
published OSP models against their real clinical data on real PK-Sim. DDI / paediatric application templates follow.

### Docs
- **Added `CHANGELOG.md` (this file) and `CLAUDE.md`.** There was no change log and the continuation doc was 50
  commits out of date; project context lived only in commit messages and a private assistant memory, so it was lost
  whenever the session or AI model changed. `CLAUDE.md` is loaded into every Claude Code session, which is what makes
  the "record every change" rule stick.
- **Rewrote `docs/CONTINUATION_PACKAGE.md` §4 to the truth**, with a pipeline-coverage table (S0–S7).

### Known gap — diagnosed 2026-09-24 (the reason every campaign stopped at S1)
Tracked as R1–R13 in the plan. The critical ones:
- **R1 — S4 and S5 never simulated anything.** `campaign/map.py::_scenarios` only created scenarios for INTERNAL
  studies in three classes (IV → S1, oral fasted → S2, fed → S3). Nothing was ever tagged S4, and EXTERNAL studies
  were skipped outright, so internal and external validation had no work and escalated.
- **R2 — the runner had no validation mode**; every stage was treated as a fit loop.
- **R4 — enzyme-cleared drugs were never metabolised on real PK-Sim.** The CPF build never attached expression
  profiles to the individual, so CYP/UGT processes had no enzyme to act on.
- **R5 — only oral solutions/suspensions could be built**; tablets and capsules raised, and S3 did not exist.
- **R8/R9 — S6 and S7 were not part of the pipeline** even though sensitivity, population, parameter CIs, the MAR
  generator and the reproducibility bundle all exist and are engine-verified.
- **R11 — the 2026-09-24 case studies were not PBPK.** With the engine host down they ran on a one-compartment
  analytical stand-in. Their four defect findings stand; their numbers are not simulation results.

## 2026-09-24

### Added
- **Twelve end-to-end case studies** driven through the real API (`deploy/dev/case_studies/`), evidence in
  `reports/case-studies/` (gitignored). *Ran on the analytical stand-in, not PK-Sim — see Known gap R11.* (84533d3)
- **Analytical stand-in engine** `deploy/dev/analytical_engine.py`: one-compartment model driven by the CPF's real
  values, with a parameter-identification task. A software fixture only; never a simulation result. (84533d3)
- **Review-inbox decisions act on the campaign**: `escalation:resolve` endpoint + `resolve_escalation()` apply
  retry / accept best / abort to a stopped single-node campaign, signing from the token's step-up (no password on the
  wire) *before* applying anything. (310c1a2)
- **Server lifecycle scripts in the repo** (`deploy/server/`): run / stop / status, shared `_env.sh`, and
  `install_autostart.sh` (no-root `@reboot` + 5-minute watchdog that respects a deliberate stop). They previously
  existed only on the server. (122ba94)
- **Sudo-optional Tailscale setup** `deploy/server/setup_tailscale.sh` (userspace mode when there is no root).
  (afcb76d, ee1b407)
- **Interface redesign** as a dark instrument (IBM Plex; teal = predicted, amber = observed) and a **fold-error
  gauge** showing predicted/observed on a log scale against the ICH M15 tier band. (0854342)

### Fixed
- **AUC compared over mismatched time windows** — prediction reduced over the simulation window, observation over
  its sampling window. A perfect model of a slowly eliminated drug was reported at +101% error and escalated.
  Predictions are now reduced over the observed window (`ObservedPK.t_last`). *Would have produced false failures on
  real submissions.* (84533d3)
- **Fit candidates not checked against the compound** — a renal drug spent a round fitting a hepatic enzyme it does
  not have. Candidates are now filtered to real, bounded, stage-permitted parameters with an engine path. (84533d3)
- **An engine crash hung the campaign at RUNNING** with the error hidden; stage failures are now recorded with the
  actual message. (84533d3)
- **Missing input file raised** where every caller expects graceful degradation. (84533d3)
- **The model silently had no clearance** — a process parameter without an `engine_binding` was dropped by the
  builder with no warning. Now reported as "NOT PLACED IN THE MODEL". (3aca992)
- **Snapshot integrity check always failed through `EngineRunner`** — the build hashed the canonical snapshot but the
  runner hashed the file bytes. Masked because server tests called `run_job.R` directly. (ba0a9ab)
- Tailscale version lookup parsed a key that does not exist; now uses the `latest` redirect. (ee1b407)

### Changed
- **Real runnable example** replaces the static Example-A mock screens; one-click "Run campaign"; real data intake
  (CSV upload, column mapping); studies merge by id instead of being replaced. (9c1be08)
- Example CPF calibrated: bound GFR clearance, MS-01 fit policies, real pKa records. (3aca992)
- All three escalation decisions now require a signature, matching `decision_options()`. (310c1a2)

### Docs
- Moved `SESSION_HANDOFF.md` into `docs/`. (999c8ca)

## 2026-09-20 → 2026-09-23

### Added
- **Guided "New project" wizard**: project → CPF → studies → MAP & sign → run, opening the live monitor. (ba0a9ab)
- **Single entry point** — the web app proxies `/api/*` to the backend: one URL, no CORS. (d4017db)
- **Deployed on the server as one tool**: Node via nvm, web + API + engine behind `http://<server>:3000`.

## 2026-09-19

### Added
- **Single-node execution mode (no Docker / no Temporal needed)**: `LocalExecutor` runs the MS-01 loop in-process
  using the same activities as the Temporal path; `FileReadStore`/`FileWriteStore` persistence seam;
  `MODELER_EXECUTION_BACKEND=local|temporal`. (3e48fa4)
- **Create-project write API** and `campaign:prepare` (MAP + NCA-derived observed PK). (b4a3526)
- **Web app** (T-26/27/28) with live read APIs for projects, CPF, campaigns, escalations, proposals.
  (817c14d, fdeaf91, acfffa7)
- **T-09** population, sensitivity and batch engine tasks, verified on the engine. (bca33e8)
- **T-24** MAR generation and rendering (DOCX / PDF-A via pandoc, Markdown fallback). (01ff5fa)
- **T-12** engine image CI, qualification gate, registration record. (c26c923)
- **T-20** agent run persistence, token/cost budgets, provider-failure handling. (5003e6f)
- **T-23** `rerun_all.R` generation; byte-exact reproduction verified on the engine. (fe2cc69)
- **T-32** validation pack generator (URS/FS, RTM, OQ evidence). (467335f)

## 2026-09-18

### Added
- **Fit loop, end to end** — CPF → PK-Sim parameter paths harvested from the engine; PI spec built; estimates
  applied to a new CPF version; strategist bounds threaded through. Verified on the engine: PI recovered GFR fraction
  1.0 from a 0.4 start. (cf4a843, 712b8ac, 83a1571, a13e746, d2ac368)
- **T-11** observed-data coverage: molar units, urine/feces fractions, geometric statistics, LLOQ. (c444720)
- **T-17** escalations, deviations and signed decisions API. (47322d0)
- **T-23 core** reproducibility gate and submission bundle. (7f36c8e)
- **T-06** Keycloak OIDC authentication and step-up signatures. (101e605)
- Auth-guarded campaign / run APIs; `GET /runs/{id}/results`. (8281c65, 9e438b8)
- **T-25** CI pipeline and requirement trace matrix. (bc5835a)

## 2026-09-17

### Added
- **T-18** deterministic NCA. (6997975)
- **Round loop wired**: build → simulate on the engine → evaluate against the tier gate → diagnose → choose action.
  (27516d6, d1386ff, 0588bd0, 2abd0a9, 902158f)
- **T-14** diagnostics ruleset; **T-15** strategist agent. (0588bd0, 2abd0a9)

### Fixed
- **`ValueOrigin.Source` enum** — a raw CPF label made PK-Sim *silently drop the simulation*. Every CPF-built
  campaign would have produced nothing. Caught by the first on-engine smoke. (6de102d)
- `run_job.R` matched the wrong result-CSV names for multi-simulation snapshots. (8e8ef8b)

## 2026-09-16

### Added
- Repository under git. Platform scaffold, engine verified on Linux (T-01), catalog harvest (T-02), CPF (T-03),
  study split (T-04). (ab20736)
- **T-10** builder coverage: Michaelis-Menten metabolism, transporters, inhibition, induction, specific binding,
  multiple-dose protocols, meal events. (0afed52, a201367)
- **T-13** campaign workflows; **T-05** campaign persistence with RLS and append-only audit; **T-07** object store;
  **T-08** results ingestion; **T-09** cancellation; **T-16** MAP generator.
  (fdb5f0d, e103d6f, c32831b, 17a98b1, dec21ab, 7b4ce26, 147f6d5)

### Docs
- Continuation package recorded T-10/T-13 progress — its last update until 2026-09-24. (cdc8a7a)
